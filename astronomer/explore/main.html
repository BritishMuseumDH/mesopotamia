The scribes of Enuma Anu Enlil<p>
The scribes of Enuma Anu Enlil were a group of men who performed many different duties relating to 
astronomy and astrology in the Babylonian court around the 6th century B.C. These scribes used 
observations of the earth and sky that had been collected over hundreds of years. <p>
Texts refer to this select group of scribes, but we still do not know exactly who they were, what 
they did, and how they were trained. However, the texts demonstrate how  experienced they were in 
observation and interpretation. <p>
The tablets below represent some of the types of texts that may have been used by the scribes of 
Enuma Anu Enlil.
