The back of this tablet describes how on the 13th night, most of the planets were not visible, Saturn had set but Mars had appeared.
<p>
During the eclipse of the moon, the north wind blew and it was cold. The eclipse happened when the moon was positioned 2 cubits in front of the stars of the constellation Cancer. The north wind blew from sunrise to moonset and it became very cold.
<p>
On the 14th night the sky was covered by clouds from sunset to moonrise and so the stars and planets could not be seen. On the nights of the 15th and 16th it was cloudy with rain.
