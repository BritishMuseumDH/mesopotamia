This letter was written by an Assyrian astronomer in about 667 B.C. to inform the king 
that an eclipse had occurred.<p>
Much of what the Assyrians knew about astronomy came from Babylonian astronomers. Even 
though this tablet was written over a thousand years after Aplum's time, the observations 
of early astronomers were still important in Mesopotamia.
