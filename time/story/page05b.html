Layard loaded many of the sculptures he had discovered onto rafts which were floated down the River Tigris. 
<p>
They were transferred to sailing ships and brought to Europe where many were displayed at the British Museum. 
<p>
People became excited by these monuments which showed scenes of Assyrian warfare, religious <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/c/ceremony.html','ceremony')">ceremonies</a> and royal building projects. The sculptures were so popular that people started making objects (such as bookends or flower pots) decorated in an 'Assyrian style'.
