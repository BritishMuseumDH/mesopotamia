When Woolley and Koldewey were excavating in Mesopotamia they could afford to hire hundreds of workers who were not skilled archaeologists.  This meant that large areas of a site could be excavated. For example, when the excavations at Babylon were closed in 1917 about half of the huge site had been uncovered.
<p>
Today archaeologists can rarely afford large numbers of diggers and have to rely on volunteers or explore only a small area of a site. This means they can work very carefully and record all the finds but does mean that a broad picture is not possible.

Most of the archaeologists are specialists. For example, they can translate cuneiform, or are experts in bone or pottery or plant remains.
