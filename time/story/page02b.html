Mesopotamia was the setting for some of the famous stories in the Bible such as the Garden of Eden, the Tower of Babel, and the journey of Abraham from the city of Ur.
<p>
One of the main sources of information about Mesopotamia was 'The History' by a man called Herodotus. He lived in Caria (modern Turkey) in the fifth century B.C.
