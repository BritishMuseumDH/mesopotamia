Archaeology is not always straightforward. French and British excavators had agreed to divide the site of Nineveh between them, but Rassam thought that the French area probably contained some important remains and so he started to excavate them at night. 
<p>
There he discovered the palace of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal. It was agreed that since Rassam had made the discovery he could continue to excavate.

The French were also unlucky at the site of Khorsabad. After Botta, another French diplomat called Victor Place directed the excavations.

He found more Assyrian reliefs and loaded them onto rafts to be floated down the River Tigris.  However, the rafts were attacked by bandits who thought there was treasure on board. Many of the rafts were overturned and the reliefs sank to the bottom of the river and were lost.
