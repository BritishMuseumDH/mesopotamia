Archaeologists dig below the surface to make their discoveries, but how did the objects they find get under the ground?
<p>
The objects could have been buried on purpose.  For instance, sometimes when a person is buried in a grave or tomb, some of their belongings are put in with them.  People also bury precious things to hide them.
<p>
But more often, the remains of buildings and any objects left in them can become covered by soil and rubbish. 
<p>
Play the Time Challenge to find out how this might happen....
