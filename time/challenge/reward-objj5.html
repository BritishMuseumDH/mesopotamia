Coins are pieces of stamped metal which are issued as money. They are very useful to archaeologists as they may have a date, or the name or image of a ruler stamped on them. If the ruler's dates are known, the coin can help date the level where it was found. Coinage was invented around 600 B.C. in western Turkey.
