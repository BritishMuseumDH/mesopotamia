Discuss different ways of measuring things e.g. imperial, metric. 
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Why is measuring important? 
	<li>If I was to make something from measurements you had given me what would I need to know?
</ul>

Discuss the Mesopotamian methods of measurement. 
<ul type="disc">
	<li>What would be a problem with a measurement based on a finger length?
</ul>

Give the pupils some string and have them divide it into fingers and cubits by marking it with a pencil. Ask them to choose a number of objects in the class and measure them, recording the results in a table. Compare the results between pupils on the board.

<ul type="disc">
	<li>Does everybody agree on the measurement? 
	<li>Why might there be differences? 
	<li>What would have to happen for everybody to agree on the size of something? 
	<li>What would happen if you wanted something made and the sizes were different? 
	<li>What would happen if you were a trader and the measurements were different between cities or countries?
</ul>

Finish by explaining that until a few hundred years ago many countries had different systems of measurement.
