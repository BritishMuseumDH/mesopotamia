Remind pupils of the different characters that appear in Mesopotamian scenes of warfare (Assyrian reliefs, Standard of Ur). Ask them to think about what kind of preparations would be necessary if they were taking an army to fight the neighbouring city. 
<ul type="disc">
	<li>What would the differences be if you were on campaign in a distant part of the empire? 
	<li>What would you need to take with you? 
	<li>What would you need more of?
</ul>

Tell the pupils that they will be members of an Assyrian campaign to the kingdom of Judah. Give each pupil (or group) a job and ask them to list the things they would need to arrange for the campaign, e.g.
<menu>
		King<br>
		Chief scribe<br>
		Commander of the army<br>
		Foot solder<br>
		Archer<br>
		Sling stone thrower<br>
		Governor of Assyrian province<br>
		Chief butler<br>
		Foreign king<br>
		Cook<br>
		Chariot driver<br>
		Priest<br>
</menu>
Each make a list of what they should prepare. Group discussion about who has the most to do. Who reports to whom?
