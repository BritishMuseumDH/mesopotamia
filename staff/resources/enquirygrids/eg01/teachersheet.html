<p>
Let the pupils spend a few minutes looking at the wall reliefs in Palaces, Warfare or Tombs Explore and choose one person to concentrate on. 
<P>
Then using the website, ask them to gather information about what that person is wearing. The attached sheet can be used, or pupils can make an information sheet of their own. Explain the sheet to the children, telling them that they are going to use this sheet to gather information about what people wore in Mesopotamia. Ask pupils to identify the person they are focusing on by their gender, profession, status, or name (a man, woman, soldier, king, attendant). Then ask pupils to look closely at what the person is wearing. Use the ‘What are they wearing?' box to describe articles of clothing and jewellery using words and/or pictures.  Use the ‘What is it made of?' box to record what material it is made of (if they do not definitely know, ask them to make a reasonable guess).
<P>
When they have finished collecting information, ask pupils to write a paragraph or make a poster, showing the person they chose, using the information they gathered about what the person wore. Ask pupils to compare the different people profiled by the class and discuss similarities and differences in what they wore in terms of types of clothing or jewellery, and the materials used to make them.

<p>
Make a chart or graph showing all of the data that the class has collected about what people in Mesopotamia wore. Discuss why they might have been wearing one type of clothing or another. Emphasise the relationships among materials, climate, types of clothing, and social status.
</p>

<p>
Ask pupils to collect information about what people wear today using the same information gathering sheet. Compare and contrast what people wear today with what the Mesopotamians wore, for instance man-made as opposed to natural fabrics. Also consider clothing worn in different climates.
