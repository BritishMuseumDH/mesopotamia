<p>
Have pupils spend a few minutes looking at Geography Explore. Then have them identify the various names and mark them either on the attached map, or pupils can draw a map of their own. Explain the sheet to the children, telling them that they are going to use this map to gather information to show some of the most important places in Mesopotamian.
<p>
When they have finished collecting information, ask pupils to write a paragraph to explain why they think the cities were built where they are. Ask them to think about the advantages and disadvantages of living in each of the cities.

Divide the class into groups and give them particular time periods e.g. 3000-2000 B.C. and A.D. 1000-2000. Ask them to fill in the maps with as many sites of those dates. Compare the results and discuss why some sites were abandoned and new sites built.
