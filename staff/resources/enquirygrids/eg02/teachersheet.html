Ask pupils to collect information using the following sheet about animals in Mesopotamia, or ask them to brainstorm a list of questions about animals in Mesopotamia. Ask them to collect information using the web site, then write a short illustrated guide to the animals they found.

<p>
Print out a copy of the line drawing of the Palaces and Warfare Explores and attach the sheets together. Instruct each pupil to choose one (or more, depending on demand) animal. Brainstorm a list of questions, creating a class ‘guide' for collecting information about the animals. Instruct pupils to collect information about their animals using the site, then ask them each to write a paragraph about their animal on an index card. Hang the ‘relief' on the wall. Connect the animals in the relief to the index cards with string.

<p>
Ask pupils to find out what other animals were in Mesopotamia.  They can learn about what they looked like, where they were from, and why they were important.  Pupils could also learn about the gods and goddesses associated with different animals.
