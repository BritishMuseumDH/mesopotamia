Put these sentences in order to show how Mesopotamian temples got higher over time until somebody came up with the idea of ziggurats:

<ul type="disc">
	<li>A way of making the temples even higher was by building huge stepped platforms (ziggurats).
<p>
<li>A new temple was built on the remains of the old one.
<p>
<li>Some ziggurats have the remains of older platforms and temples buried inside them.
<p>
<li>Some platforms had more than one level.
<p>
<li>Temples were built on mud brick platforms.
<p>
<li>The remains of the old temple was buried in a bigger platform.
<p>
<li>The remains of the temple formed a low platform of mud.
<p>
<li>When an old temple needed rebuilding it was demolished.
<p>
</ul>
