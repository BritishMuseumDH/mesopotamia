<p>
Look at modern pictures, photographs, sculpture etc. Works of art often show things that are important to people. Discuss why people think some things are worth painting, sculpting etc. For example, why are paintings and sculptures made of favourite animals or important people like kings, soldiers, and scientists? 
<p>
Choose a decorated object from Mesopotamia e.g. the Standard of Ur, an Assyrian relief. 
<p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>What do you think were the most important things for the people of Mesopotamia?
<p>
<li>Look for an example of something the Mesopotamians thought important enough to show as part of the decoration and explain why you think this was.
</ul>
