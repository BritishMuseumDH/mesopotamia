<p>
Have pupils spend a few minutes looking at the wall reliefs in Palaces or Warfare and identify the king. Then, have them gather information about what the king is wearing and doing from the site. The attached sheet can be used, or pupils can make a gathering sheet of their own. Explain the sheet to the children, telling them that they are going to use this sheet to gather information about Mesopotamian kings (let them know that generally only men were rulers). Ask pupils to look closely at what the king is wearing. Use the ‘What is the king wearing?' box to describe articles of clothing and jewellery using words and/or pictures.  Use the ‘What is he doing?' box to record some of the activities of the king.
<p>
When they have finished collecting information, ask pupils to write a paragraph or make a poster, showing the king, using the information they gathered about what he wore. Ask pupils to compare the posters or written information for differences.

Make a chart or graph showing all of the data that the class has collected about Mesopotamian kings. Discuss why they might have been wearing particular cloths and jewellery and why it the king who undertakes specific activities.

Ask pupils to collect information about what kings (or queens) wear and do today using the same information gathering sheet. Compare and contrast what kings (or queens) do and wear today with the Mesopotamian examples.
