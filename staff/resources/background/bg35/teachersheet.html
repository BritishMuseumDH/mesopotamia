<p>
The Mesopotamians used the following systems of measurement
<p>
<b>Measurement of length</b>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>finger = 1.65 cm
	<li>30 fingers = 1 cubit  = 49.5 cm
	<li>6 cubits = 1 reed
	<li>30 cubits = 1 cord
</ul>

<b>Measurement of area</b>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>1 sar = 36m2
	<li>100 sar = 1 iku
	<li>1800 iku = 1 bur
</ul>

The sar was used for measuring the area of houses, the iku and bur for field areas
<p>
<b>Measurement of capacity</b>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>1 sila = 0.82 litre
	<li>10 sila = 1 ban
	<li>6 ban = 1 nigida
	<li>5 nigida= 1 gur
</ul>

<b>Mathematics</b>
<p>
Whereas we use the decimal system with a base of 10, the Sumerians used the sexigesimal system, which has a base of 60. From 3000 B.C. individual symbols were used for the values 36,000, 3600, 600, 60 and 10.
<p>
In the later Babylonian cuneiform script (from 2000 B.C.) the sexigesimal system was used for mathematics and astronomy, while the decimal system was used for everyday purposes such as trading and accounting. 
<p>
Only two signs are used in the sexigesimal system. Everything depended on the order of the wedges, reading from left to right. 
<p>
One of the principal uses of Babylonian mathematics was for astronomy.
