The basic form of government was monarchy, normally hereditary kings, in which the throne passed from father to son. Being able to claim descent from a line of kings was regarded as a form of legitimacy and proudly proclaimed in royal inscriptions, even when untrue.
<p>
At certain times and places kings were regarded as divine - and occasionally there is evidence for the worship of statues of the king - but more usually they thought of themselves as the representatives on earth of the state's supreme god. Kings stress in their inscriptions that they had been chosen by the god. There was a formal coronation, and kings were presented with their symbols of office in temples.
<p>
A king's responsibility was to care for the gods by building and maintaining temples, to look after (literally ‘shepherd') his people, and to administer justice. As the representative of the gods the king had an important part to play in rituals and festivals. One ritual was the substitute king. When bad luck was foretold (in the omens) the king stepped aside and a substitute replaced him for one hundred days in the hope that any bad luck would befall him rather than the real king.
<p>
Kings lived in palaces though this was not just the king's residence but also the centre of government. The buildings contained private apartments, offices, workshops, kitchens, storerooms and libraries. By the first millennium B.C. Assyrian kings had harems and often a wing of the palace was the home of the royal wives.
<p>
Letters to the king show that he was concerned with matters of detail about running his kingdom. One of his most important roles was as judge. Judgments by kings survive from about 2350 B.C. onwards. These were not collections of laws used as reference works in legal disputes but numerous social reforms which the king had issued as decrees, dressed up as royal inscriptions. The most famous laws are those of king Hammurabi (1792-1750 B.C.)  inscribed on stone stelae set up in at least two major cities, Sippar and Babylon, with copies written on clay tablets. His code was recopied and preserved for centuries. The laws cover all manner of crime such as accusations of witchcraft, murder, theft, property rights, regulation of prices and wages for workers.
