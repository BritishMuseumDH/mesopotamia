From the first settled communities around 8000 B.C. the inhabitants of the Near East developed almost all the techniques that formed the basis of civilized life before the industrial revolution: architecture, transport, metalworking, carpentry, pottery, glass- making, textile manufacture and leather-working as well as many processes associated with farming and food preparation. In southern Mesopotamia irrigation and flood control were necessary and this gave rise to a number of subsidiary technologies of water management, including canal-building, water storage and drainage. For some crafts, such as pottery or metalworking, it is possible to work out how objects were made from surviving artefacts. A few texts give detailed information on the methods employed in such technologies as glass manufacture and brewing.
<p>
<b>Pottery</b> 
<p>
People had been using clay to make objects since about 8000 B.C. but true pottery was only possible once the ability to control the firing had been mastered. This appears around 6000 B.C. Distinctive shapes of pottery reflected their use, and fashions changed over time and between regions. Early pottery was made of slabs or coils of clay. The potters wheel was developed in the mid-fourth millennium B.C.
<p>
<b>Metalwork</b> 
<p>
As early as the seventh millennium B.C. objects were manufactured out of copper. The earliest objects were shaped by hammering but by the end of the 4th millennium B.C. copper objects were cast from smelted metal. At the same time gold, silver and lead also came into use. The cire perdue, or lost-wax method of casting complicated shapes in bronze, gold or silver was invented in the 4th millennium B.C. First a model was made out of wax over a clay core. This was covered with more clay and then heated so that the wax melted and ran away. Molten metal was poured into the space left by the wax which would be broken open to release the complete object. The properties of copper were improved by alloying with other metals: first antimony or arsenic, then tin, lead and zinc (c. 700 B.C.). In the 2nd millennium B.C. iron was manufactured but the technology was not perfected until the first millennium B.C.
<p>
<b>Textiles</b>
<p>
Cloth was manufactured from a variety of materials such as wool, linen (flax), and palm fibre. Early evidence dates from around 7000 B.C. with impressions left by textiles on clay objects. Cylinder seals of the late fourth millennium B.C. appear to show women gathered together to weave textiles and early texts refer to hundreds of women employed by the palace and temple in textile manufacture.  Spindle whorls are common as far back in time as the sixth millennium B.C. In the second millennium B.C. textile production in Babylonia and Assyria was important (Assyrian merchants exported it to Anatolia). Cotton, native to India, is first mentioned in Assyrian inscriptions of the seventh century B.C. The same period saw the introduction of silk from China.
<p>
<b>Faience</b> 
<p>
Faience is an artificial glazed material and was  made in Mesopotamia by 4000 B.C. but glaze was not applied to pottery until the 2nd millennium B.C.
<p>
<b>Glass</b>
<p>
Mesopotamian craftsmen invented glass around 1600 B.C. Glass vessels were moulded on a core, i.e. molten glass was poured over a clay core which was scraped away when the glass solidified. Rods of coloured glass were sometimes let into the still plastic surface of vessels and then dragged up and down to create a zigzag pattern.
<p>
<b>Mud-brick making and building</b>
<p>
The earliest mud-bricks date to around 8000 B.C. and were moulded by hand and had a flat base and a round top. Later bricks were made in a mould. Houses were made of mud-bricks and usually had flat roofs. The walls and the roofs were coated with plaster made of mud and straw. A damp course was created using burnt bricks (which was expensive) or bitumen. When the buildings fell down or were abandoned the roof timbers were removed but the rest of the structure was left to form a small, flat mound of mud. 
<p>
To make bricks mud, chopped straw and water are mixed together and allowed to stand for some days. The straw stops the bricks from cracking as they dry. Sometimes gravel or other material is used instead of straw. The brickmaker takes a lump of this mud mixture and presses it into a square or rectangular mould. The bricks are then left to dry in the sun for as little as a few days depending on the weather. Bricks are normally made in May to June after harvest, when there is little danger of rain and when straw is available. The shape and size of the mud-bricks varied from period to period and thus the type of bricks in a building can sometimes help to determine its date.
