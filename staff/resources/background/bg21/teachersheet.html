Mesopotamian astronomy was actually concerned with astrology - the observation and recording of the movement of the moon, planet and stars as well as weather and other natural phenomena for predicting the future. The universe was believed to be controlled by gods and goddesses and it was thought they provided an indication of their plans by revealing signs for humans.
<p>
The earliest interest in celestial events for predicting the future dates from around 1700 B.C. Political, economic or social events are associated with the position of the moon and sun (lunar and solar omens). The compilation of these omens reached a peak in the first millennium B.C. together with omens based on the planets, stars, earthquakes and weather patterns. They were all concerned with predicting an outcome for the king and country and normally took the pattern ‘if x happens then y will be the result'. The standard series of celestial omens was called Enuma Anu Enlil, the title coming from the first three words, ‘When (the gods) Anu and Enlil ...'.
<p>
In the first millennium B.C. scholars in various Assyrian and Babylonian cities observed the heavens and made regular reports and predictions, compiling reference texts . One example, compiled around 650 B.C., is entitled MUL.APIN (‘Plough Star') and is a summary of early astronomical knowledge of the stars, sun, moon and planets.
<p>
Later developments (from around 500 B.C.) included the development of personal predictions (horoscopes), the invention of the zodiac and the practice of keeping astronomical diaries. Babylonian astronomy was famous in the Greek world and influenced Indian, Arabic and medieval European science.
