The most efficient way of transporting goods was by water, as most places in south Mesopotamia could be reached through a network of rivers and canals. Rafts and coracles were the main form of river boat (both were common on the Tigris and Euphrates until recently). Larger ships made of wood or bundles of reeds were paddled or punted in the southern marshes of Mesopotamia and also sailed along the Gulf to places like Bahrain. Where travel by water was not possible, normally donkeys or mules were used and sometimes human porters. After about 2000 B.C. the introduction of the horse from Central Asia enabled messengers to travel more quickly. Camels became increasingly important with the rise of the desert tribes in the first millennium B.C.

Wheeled vehicles were known in the Near East from about 3500 B.C. However, in the sandy or muddy conditions of the south sledges were often more practical and in the mountains vehicles were useless before proper roads were built (c. 800 B.C.). Sledges were used for transporting the stone for Assyrian palace reliefs, pulled by large numbers of prisoners of war. Local journeys were often made in carts with solid wooden wheels generally pulled by oxen.

Chariots developed from the heavy carts of the Sumerian period. With the introduction of the horse into Mesopotamia chariots became lighter. Assyrian wall reliefs show a technological development in chariot design with wheels of six spokes in the ninth century changing to eight spokes in the seventh century B.C. They were used predominantly for warfare.
