Assyrian kings had been leading their armies towards the Mediterranean since the twelfth century B.C. They were attracted by the wealth of the trading cities along the coast and the rich resources of the region such as the cedar trees of Lebanon. Annual campaigns ensured a regular supply of tribute from the small city-states and kingdoms. Gradually, as Assyrian power increased, many of these western states were incorporated into the growing Assyrian empire. By the end of the eighth century B.C. kingdoms like Damascus and Israel were directly controlled by Assyrian governors. Many of the cities along the coast, in what the Greeks called Phoenicia, were left semi-independent. As long as they supplied tribute each year they were relatively free to pursue their own agendas. In 701 B.C., however, a coalition of these states was formed against Assyria. At this date Assyria was ruled by Sennacherib. He had been on the throne for three years and it was important for him to show his authority over the western lands of his empire. 
<p>
According to Sennacherib's inscriptions, Hezekiah, the king of Judah, had joined with the rebels. After marching along the coast and receiving the submission of cities like Sidon and Arvad, Sennacherib led his armies against Judah. He attacked the city of Lachish, one of the most important cities in Judah after the capital Jerusalem. The Assyrian siege and eventual conquest of Lachish was such an important event that Sennacherib later had it portrayed in a series of wall reliefs in his palace at Nineveh.
<p>
Excavations at Lachish have revealed the level of the city that was destroyed by the Assyrians. A huge ramp, which the Assyrians built against the city gate, and up which the soldiers and siege engines could attack, was discovered. Arrow heads and sling stones survive showing the ferocity of the Assyrian attack.
<p>
Sennacherib makes no mention in his inscriptions of attacking Jerusalem, saying only that Hezekiah sent him tribute.
<p>
Accounts in the Old Testament provide an alternative version of events. According to the  book of Isaiah, Sennacherib had sent representatives from Lachish to Jerusalem where they demanded Hezekiah's surrender. Hezekiah had the wells outside Jerusalem blocked to prevent the Assyrians laying siege (2 Chronicles 32). According to the biblical account, an angel destroyed the Assyrian army. 
<p>
The Greek historian Herodotus, writing around 450 B.C., gives another account. He says that the Assyrians were encamped around Jerusalem when mice came out of the city and ate the strings of the Assyrian bows. Unable to shoot arrows, the Assyrians went home.
<p>
Although clearly Jerusalem was not taken, the kingdom of Judah was weakened and the loss of Lachish would have been great. Sennacherib would have been able to return to Nineveh having crushed the rebellion.
