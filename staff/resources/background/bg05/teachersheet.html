Most of what we know about diplomats dates from the second and first millennia B.C. It seems that royal representatives often travelled with merchants. Passports were issued to diplomats along with letters of introduction.
<p>
Once the diplomat had arrived in a foreign country he might be kept waiting to see officials or the king.  Representatives of allied countries, however, were usually allowed direct access to the palace. Translators were employed on the court staff. Relations between rulers were cultivated through enquiries after their health and by the exchange of valuable gifts. Alliances were often cemented by the sending of a royal princess for marriage to the foreign king. Some letters show that her father continued to be concerned for the girl's well-being after the marriage had taken place. 
<p>
The diplomats were frequently fed and housed by the foreign state. However, permission was often required to leave the court and some representatives were kept as virtual hostages. Diplomats were clearly expected to gather as much information as possible about the court and the country they were visiting and this was often checked with other officials. 
<p>
Kings sometimes ordered their weaker allies not to accept the diplomats of enemies or complained when this took place. Diplomats could even be turned back at the borders. In one of the Amarna letters, the Babylonian king (Burnaburiash) complains about the Assyrians (allegedly his vassals) sending a delegation to the Egyptian court. 
<p>
Diplomacy in times of war could involve the most important officials. When the Assyrian army under Sennacherib attacked the kingdom of Judah, his chief butler, a senior official, had to shout to the officials of Hezekiah who were standing on the walls of Jerusalem.
