<p>
The earliest evidence for warfare dates from around 3200 B.C. Cylinder seal impressions show people being killed or beaten while a king looks on holding a spear or firing arrows.
<p>
One side of the Standard of Ur shows chariots and infantry soldiers. By 2500 B.C. there are written accounts of Sumerian city states fighting. A stone sculpture of this period shows a king holding a spear leading his army into battle. An account of the war, between the kingdom of Lagash and the neighbouring kingdom of Umma, is carved around the images in cuneiform. The war was fought over a disputed area of farmland and the conflict lasted for several generations. Control of land and particularly access to water were probably the two main causes of warfare.
<p>
Many armies were dispatched to acquire booty. This was the principal method of acquiring exotic materials like stone and metal. Sumerian images show that the main weapon of soldiers were the spear and axe. Spearheads, axes, swords and arrowheads were made of copper or bronze.
<p>
By 1700 B.C. chariots drawn by horses had become one of the most important forms of attack. The Hittites from Turkey and the Egyptians had huge chariot forces and chariots formed a central part of the Assyrian army. (see <a href="../bg10/home.html" target="_parent">Travel</a>)
<p>
By the end of the second millennium iron was being smelted and gradually came to be used for weapons and armour. The Assyrians were able to build a huge empire because they possessed a standing army (rather than one recruited each campaigning season as was usual before), and they faced little unified opposition from other states. One of their main aims was to acquire horses (for chariots) and metals (for weapons and bullion) from the mountainous regions to the north and west of Assyria. Royal inscriptions mention thousands of soldiers, supported by scribes, priests, cooks and  armourers. Novel forms of attack are represented on Assyrian reliefs such as siege towers constructed of wood covered with hide. These were wheeled up to city walls to allow archers to fire at closer range. Attached to the front of these towers was a long wooden battering ram. Causing the walls of a city to collapse either by battering or sapping is often represented on the wall reliefs.
<p>
Although the army was used to maintain order, the empire was held together through administration. Letters on all subjects were sent by provincial governors to the king. They were expected to organise the supply of troops for the army as it passed through their territory. A messenger system ensured orders travelled across the empire quickly from the palace and news flowed back to the king.
