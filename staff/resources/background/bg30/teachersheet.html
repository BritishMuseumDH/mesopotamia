The earliest large-scale buildings found in Mesopotamia appear to have been temples, although some ordinary buildings of larger size may have belonged to local chiefs or wealthy people.
<p>
From 3500 B.C. when bigger settlements like Uruk were developing, enormous buildings in the centre of the city may have served as a meeting place or ceremonial centre for the community leader. There is no clear evidence, however, for a specific residence but this may be due to lack of excavation.
<p>
Only from around 2500 B.C. are buildings found which could be described as palaces. These are large structures, surrounded by thick walls with numerous rooms devoted to different activities such as textile manufacture, metalwork, kitchens, reception rooms and shrines. They are like miniature versions of the city. This is a typical feature of palaces (compare for example Hampton Court Palace with its workshops and kitchens designed to serve a huge court).
<p>
One of the best known palaces dates to around 1800 B.C. at the city of Mari. It was rebuilt over many generations with the last building dating to the time of king Zimri-Lim, a contemporary of Hammurabi of Babylon (who sacked the palace which was then abandoned). There are quarters for the queens, large courtyards where merchandise could be collected or taxed, storerooms, a throne room and numerous workshops and kitchens. The walls of some rooms and courts were decorated with paintings. The huge building was surrounded by thick walls. It was a clear demonstration of the power and wealth of the king.
<p>
The rulers of Assyria built a series of palaces on raised terraces to separate them from the ordinary people and to dominate the capital city. During the Assyrian empire of the first millennium B.C. kings would have new palaces built on coming to the throne. They decorated the walls of important rooms with stone slabs carved in relief.  Old palaces continued to be occupied or used for storage. For example much of the material excavated in the palace of Ashurnasirpal II at Nimrud dated from after it had ceased being the royal residence and was used as a store house by later kings.
