<p>
Begin the discussion by asking pupils to think about why gods and goddesses are important. Ask pupils if they have heard of any gods and goddesses from Mesopotamia. 

<ul type="disc">
	<li>Why are gods and goddesses important? 
	<li>Who were the gods and goddesses of Mesopotamia? </ul>


Explain that the Mesopotamians had many different gods and goddesses, each with a different purpose. Give examples of gods and goddesses that represented different aspects of life, geography and natural phenomena. 
<p>
Show photographs of objects showing gods and goddesses and ask pupils to comment on the appearance of the gods and goddesses. Describe what you see. Describe what the gods and goddesses in this picture look like. 

<ul type="disc">
	<li>What are they wearing? 
	<li>What are they doing? 
	<li>How can you (or can you?) tell they are a god or goddess? 
</ul>
Point out that some of the gods and goddesses are wearing hats or crowns with animal horns. Others look like monsters.
<p>
Ask pupils to think about why the Mesopotamians might have shown their gods and goddesses with the horns (or other features) of animals. 
<p>
Close the discussion by reading or telling an ancient Mesopotamian myth e.g. the Epic of Creation.
