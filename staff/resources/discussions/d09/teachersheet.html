Explain that Mesopotamia, especially the south, has few resources: no stone or metal or good wood. Ask the pupils to think about what they could do without these things and how they might try and get some.  
<ul type="disc">
	<li>What do you use or see every day that is made of stone or wood or metal? 
	<li>How would you try and get these materials?
	<li>If people refused to trade things for the materials how would you get them?
</ul>

Tell them that the most important things in Mesopotamia were fertile soil and water to feed it. Discuss what might happen if somebody had the river diverted or refused to allow people from a neighbouring country to take water from it. 
<ul type="disc">
	<li>If you were the ruler of a country how would you protect your fertile fields?
	<li>What would you do if the ruler of another country decided to dam the river?
</ul>

Show pictures of Sumerian armies (e.g. on the Standard of Ur) and Assyrian soldiers (e.g. from Siege of Lachish reliefs). Explain that the first is much earlier than the second and ask if they can see differences in weapons or equipment.
<p>
Discuss what the armies might be fighting about. Discuss what was needed for tools and weapons. Explain that the Sumerians used donkeys to pull their chariots but later horses were used by the Assyrians. The best horses were found to the north of Assyria.
<ul type="disc">
	<li>What would you do as king of Assyria to get more horses for your chariots? 
</ul>

Explain the idea of an empire (the control of foreign lands). Explore with the pupils why some countries can build empires. Discuss the availability of better equipment, lack of opposition, better organization. 
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Can anyone think why some countries are able to build empires? 
	<li>What would make it easier for countries to build an empire?
</ul>

Finish by discussing methods other than warfare for resolving problems.
<ul type="disc">
	<li>What methods other than warfare could the people have used to get what they wanted?
</ul>
