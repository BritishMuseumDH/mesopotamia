Begin a discussion by asking pupils to identify what they think they would find in a palace. 

<ul type="disc">
	<li>What is special about a palace? 
	<li>Why would a king or queen want such a big building?
	<li>How does it differ from your home?
</ul>
Show pupils a plan of an Assyrian palace. Explain that this shows only the layout. It is difficult to know how many floors the building had. 

<ul type="disc">
	<li>How might archaeologists work out if there was an upper floor? 
</ul>

Ask the pupils to think about the thickness of walls. 

<ul type="disc">
	<li>Do you think the walls would have supported an upper floor?
	<li>If there had been an upper floor what would have happened to it when the palace was burnt? 
	<li>What might you find at ground level to show that there had been a upper floor?
</ul>

Discuss how an archaeologist might work out what each room was used for.

<ul type="disc">
	<li>How might you find out what each room was used for? 
	<li>What might an archaeologist find to show that a room had been used as a library (kitchen, bedroom, throne room, dining room etc.)? 
	<li>How might the wall relief decoration help show what the rooms had been used for? 
	<li>What might a room decorated with religious scenes been used for? 
	<li>If you had been king, what decoration might you have wanted to show your important guests?
</ul>
