<p>
Discuss how people decorate their walls. Talk about paint and particularly wall-paper. Show the pupils some pictures of Assyrian wall reliefs.
<p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Why do people decorate the walls of their homes?</ul>
<p>
Use the map. Show the children where Assyria and Nineveh are on the map and discuss the fact that the palace was built there by an Assyrian king. 

<ul type="disc">
	<li>Why might the king of Assyria want to decorate the walls of his palace?</ul>
<p>
Explain to the children that the palace was built from thousands of mud bricks and that the wall reliefs which they are looking at are made of slabs of stone. Explain that the stone slabs were set into the mud brick walls and carved using metal chisels.

<ul type="disc">
	<li>Why would the king use stone to decorate the walls of his palace? </ul>
<p>
Show pupils the line drawings of the siege of Lachish relief and ask them to share what they see. 
<p>
Discuss what the purpose of wall reliefs was, and what type of scenes appear in wall reliefs. 

<ul type="disc">
	<li>Why might a king want to show visitors to his palace scenes of himdefeating enemies?</ul>
<p>
Close the discussion by explaining to the children that the palace was set on fire by an invading army and that the reliefs were damaged when the roof fell in.
