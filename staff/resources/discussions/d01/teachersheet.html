<p>Begin a discussion by asking pupils to identify some of the basic necessities of life (i.e.: what they require from their environment on a fundamental level to ensure survival), such as food, water and shelter. Then discuss how the natural resources and landscape of a place can affect whether or not people settle there. </p>


<ul>
<li>Can people grow food there? </li>
<li>Is there an adequate and sustainable water source? </li>
</ul>
Show pupils a map of Mesopotamia and ask them to describe the land. 
<ul>
<li>Is there a source of water? </li>
<li>How much fertile land is there? </li>
<li>How is it distributed? </li>
</ul>
Ask pupils to comment on how the nature of this landscape might affect the way that people settle and ultimately use the land. 
<ul>
<li>Where would they settle, and why? 
</ul>

<p>Explain some of the ways that the landscape and climate in Mesopotamia was unique, and how people used the land. You could make a link with modern Iraq by discussing recent changes made by humans to the environment, and how they have affected the way people use the land in Iraq today.</p>

<p>Close the discussion by emphasising the impact of the land on the way the Mesopotamians lived and the use they made of natural resources.</p>
