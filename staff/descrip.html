<!--- -----------------CHAPTER INTRODUCTION --->
<p>
The site is divided into ten ‘chapters' which address themes or topics relevant to the civilisations of Mesopotamia: Sumerian, Babylonian, and Assyrian. The ten ‘chapters' are presented on a menu page where the user can choose a chapter by clicking on the word or icon relating to that chapter. 
<P>
For each chapter there is a ‘Doormat' page, which is an atmospheric introductory page to the chapter. The Doormat page will automatically switch to the ‘Home Page' after a few seconds. However, clicking on the picture will switch it immediately. The ‘Home Page' is an introductory page for the chapter. 
<P>
Within each ‘chapter' there are three sections: ‘Story', ‘Explore' and ‘Challenge': 
<ul>
<LI>The 'Story' is a presentation of information in a narrative form. Since the visual material surviving from Mesopotamia is limited, several of the stories use specially-commissioned imaginative illustrations.
<p>
<LI>
The 'Explore' is a non-linear presentation of information. The pupil controls the order in which they access the information. It is then the responsibility of the pupil (and/or the teacher) to make larger connections among ideas and information and place the information in a context or framework. <p>
<LI>
The 'Challenge' is an activity that allows pupils to practise certain skills (historical, analytical, mathematical, observational) within the context of a theme or topic relevant to Mesopotamia.
