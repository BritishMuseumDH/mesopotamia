<b>Discussions: </b>
<br>      
A discussion is a way of introducing the class to a particular topic, which may be specific to Mesopotamia, or may relate to particular historical skills. It provides a line of questioning for the teacher to develop, and also includes any additional background information which teachers may need. 
<P>

<b>Worksheets:</b> 
<br>
An information-gathering activity, which asks the user to collect data from the site, and then to use this material to carry out a further task. 
<P>
All worksheets are accompanied by teachers' notes, which provide the imaginative background to the exercise, explain its use by either individuals or a full class, and suggest extensions which children could move on to once they have finished the worksheet. They also include links to any necessary background information which teachers may need. 
<P>

<b>Follow-ups: </b>
<br>      
These cover a range of further activities: they may be practical, involving more art-based work, or they may extend the content to cover other ancient or contemporary civilizations. 
<P>

<b>Background information sheets:</b>
<br>
Since there are fewer general books available about Mesopotamia than about other ancient cultures, we have included a wider range of general information which teachers may find helpful.
