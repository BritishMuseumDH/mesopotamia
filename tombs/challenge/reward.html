<h3><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=+1>The Royal Game of Ur - a board game from Mesopotamia</font></h3>

<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE=+1>

<p>The game board dates to about 2600 B.C.  It is called the Royal Game of Ur because Woolley thought that the grave in which it was found belonged to a King or Queen of Ur.</p>

<p>The wood board had decayed, but the twenty squares of shell were still in position and well-preserved: there are five squares with flower rosettes, five with 'eyes', five with circled dots and five with different designs of dots.  Rosettes are symbols of good luck in Mesopotamia, so it was probably lucky to land on these squares. </p>

<p>There were no game pieces found with this board but some sets made of shell were found in other graves at Ur. The boards were hollow so that you could store the gaming pieces inside.  Four-sided and <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/s/stick.html','stick')">stick dice</a> were also found.</p>
