Scribes were very important people. They were trained to write cuneiform and record many of the languages spoken in Mesopotamia.
<p>
Without scribes, letters would not have been written or read, royal monuments would not have been carved with cuneiform, and stories would have been told and then forgotten.
<p>
Scribes wrote on different shaped objects depending on the type of information they wanted to record.
