Clay was pressed into <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/m/mould.html','mould')">moulds</a>. When the clay was dry, the bricks were turned out. They were stacked together with gaps between them.

The stack was covered with a dome of mud and then dry twigs were pushed through a hole in the side. The twigs were set on fire and allowed to burn for a long time. When cool, the bricks were removed from the dome. Firing the bricks made them water resistant.
