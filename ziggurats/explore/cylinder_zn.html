<center><h3>Nabonidus Cylinder </h3></center>
<p>
I am Nabonidus, king of Babylon, patron of <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/e/esagila.html','esagila')">Esagila</a> and <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/e/ezida.html','ezida')">Ezida</a>, devotee of the great gods. E-lugal-galga-sisa, the ziggurat of E-gish-nu-gal in Ur, which Ur-Nammu, a former king, built but did not finish it (and) his son Shulgi finished its building. On the inscriptions of Ur-Nammu and his son Shulgi I read that Ur-Nammu built that ziggurat but did not finish it (and) his son Shulgi finished its building.
<P>

Now that ziggurat had become old, and I undertook the construction of that ziggurat on the foundations which Ur-Nammu and his son Shulgi built following the original plan with <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/b/bitumen.html','bitumen')">bitumen</a> and baked brick. I rebuilt it for <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/s/sin.html','sin')">Sin</a>, the lord of the gods of heaven and <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/u/undworld.html','undworld')">underworld</a>, the god of gods, who lives in the great heavens, the lord of E-gish-nu-gal in Ur, my lord. 
<P>
Sin, lord of the gods, king of the gods of heaven and underworld, god of gods, who lives in the great heavens, when you enter with joy into this temple may the welfare of Esagila, Ezida and Egishshirgal, the temples of your great divinity, be always on your lips. And let the fear of your great divinity be in the heart of your people so that they will not sin against your great divinity.
<P>

Let their [the temples] foundations be established as the heavens. As for me, Nabonidus, king of Babylon, save me from sin against your great divinity, and give me life until distant days. And as for Belshazzar my firstborn son, my own child, let the fear of your great divinity be in his heart, and may he commit no sin; may he enjoy happiness in life.
