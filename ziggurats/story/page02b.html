Some of the buildings excavated at Uruk date to around 3200 B.C. They are made from hundreds of thousands of mud-bricks. Some buildings had foundations of stone: a rare and expensive material in Sumer.

Sometimes the walls were decorated with small cones of baked clay. The sharp end was pushed into the plaster on the walls and the flat end was painted blue, black, yellow, white or red. They were arranged in patterns to form a mosaic. These mosaics were also used to decorate enormous mud-brick columns.
