<center><h3>The charioteer</h3></center>

The charioteer drives his chariot towards the battle. He holds the <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/r/reins.html','reins')">reins</a> of his horses tightly in his hands. The chariot is pulled by two horses with a spare horse alongside.  
<p>
The horses are ready for battle. A groom holds their <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/b/bridle.html','bridle')">bridles</a> until it is time for the charioteer to join the battle. The horses are wearing necklaces.
<p>
The charioteer has many weapons with him. He carries a sword in a <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/s/sheath.html','sheath')">sheath</a> attached to his belt and there is a spear in the back of the chariot.  Hanging on the side of the chariot are two <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/q/quiver.html','quiver')">quivers</a> holding axes and many arrows. 
<p>
In the background are two vultures. One vulture attacks a wounded enemy soldier.
