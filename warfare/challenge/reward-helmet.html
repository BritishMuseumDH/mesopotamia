Pointed helmets like this were commonly worn by Assyrian soldiers. It is made of iron, which must have made it very hot to wear. This one was found in the palace of the Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal at Nimrud by the archaeologist Henry Layard. There were at least four different crested helmets found along with it but all were badly decayed.
