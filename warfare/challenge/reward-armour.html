84 pieces of this bronze scale armour were found at an archaeological site in north-western Iran. They are Assyrian and date to the eighth or seventh century B.C. Each piece has a central ridge and holes for sewing the pieces together. The holes are punched in one of two patterns which shows us that some of the plates were for the right side of a person, others were for the left.
