<h3>The standard inscription says:</h3>

Palace of Ashurnasirpal, priest of <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/a/ashur.html','ashur')">Ashur</a>, favourite of Enlil and Ninurta, beloved of Anu and Dagan, the weapon of the great gods, the mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria; son of Tukulti-Ninurta, the great king, the mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, the son of Adad-nirari, the great king, the mighty king, king of Assyria; the <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/v/valiant.html','valiant')">valiant</a> man, who acts with the support of Ashur, his lord and has no equal among the princes of the four quarters of the world; the wonderful shepherd who is not afraid of battle; the great flood which none can oppose; the king who makes those who are not subject to him <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/s/subsive.html','subsive')">submissive</a>; who has <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/s/subjgate.html','subjgate')">subjugated</a> all mankind; the mighty warrior who treads on the necks of his enemies, tramples down all foes, and shatters the forces of the proud; the king who acts with the support of the great gods, and whose hand has conquered all lands, who has subjugated all the mountains and received their <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/t/tribute.html','tribute')">tribute</a>, taking <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/h/hostage.html','hostage')">hostages</a> and establishing his power over all countries.
<p>
When Ashur, the lord who called me by my name and has made my kingdom great, entrusted his merciless weapon to my lordly arms, I overthrew the widespread troops of the land of Lullume in battle. With the assistance of Shamash and Adad, the gods who help me, I thundered like Adad the destroyer over the troops of the Nairi lands, Habhi, Shubaru, and Nirib. I am the king who has brought into submission at his feet the lands from beyond the Tigris to Mount Lebanon and the Great Sea [the Mediterranean], the whole of the land of Laqe, the land of Suhi as far as Rapiqu, and whose hand has conquered from the source of the river Shubnat to the land of Urartu.
<p>
The area from the mountain passes of Kirruri to the land of Gilzanu, from beyond the Lower Zab to the city of Til-Bari which is north of the land of Zaban, from the city of Til-sha-abtani to Til-sha-Zabdani, Hirimu and Harutu, fortresses of the land of <a name="obs"></a>Karduniash [Babylon], I have restored to the borders of my land. From the mountain passes of Babite to the land of Hashmar I have counted the inhabitants as people of my land. Over the lands which I have subjugated I have appointed my governors, and they do <a href="#obs" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/o/obesance.html','obesance')">obeisance</a>.
<p>
I am Ashurnasirpal, the celebrated prince, who reveres the great gods, the fierce dragon, conqueror of the cities and mountains to their furthest extent, king of rulers who have tamed the stiff-necked peoples, who is crowned with splendour, who is not afraid of battle, the merciless champion who shakes resistance, the glorious king, the shepherd, the protection of the whole world, the king, the word of whose mouth destroys mountains and seas, who by his lordly attack has forced fierce and merciless kings from the rising to the setting sun to acknowledge one rule.
<p>
The former city of Kalhu [Nimrud], which Shalmaneser king of Assyria, a prince who preceded me, had built, that city had fallen into ruins and lay deserted. That city I built anew. I took the peoples whom my hand had conquered from the lands which I subjugated, from the land of Suhi, from the whole of the land of Laqe, from the city of Sirqu on the other side of the Euphrates, from the furthest extent of the land of Zamua, from Bit-Adini and the land of Hatte and from Lubarna, king of the land of Patina, and made them settle there.
<p>
I renewed the ancient mound and dug down to the water level. I sank the foundations 120 brick courses deep. A palace with walls of cedar, cypress, juniper, box wood, meskannu-wood, terebinth and tamerisk, I founded as my royal residence for my lordly pleasure for ever.
<p><a name="ala"></a>
Creatures of the mountains and seas I fashioned in white limestone and <a href="#ala" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/a/alabaster.html','alabaster')">alabaster</a> and set them up at its gates. I adorned it, and made it glorious, and set ornamental knobs of <a href="#ala" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/b/bronze.html','bronze')">bronze</a> all around it. I fixed doors of cedar, cypress, juniper and meskannu-wood in its gates. I took in great quantities, and placed there silver, gold, tin, bronze and iron, <a href="#ala" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/b/booty.html','booty')">booty</a> taken by my hands from the lands which I conquered.
