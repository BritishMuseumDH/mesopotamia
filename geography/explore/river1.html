Life in Mesopotamia was concentrated between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates.  The rivers flowed from the mountain areas in the north down to the Gulf.
<p>
They were used for transport, but were also the means by which the people of Mesopotamia could live, as they provided water to drink and to irrigate the surrounding land.  Once the land was irrigated, it could produce crops and other foods for the people to eat.
