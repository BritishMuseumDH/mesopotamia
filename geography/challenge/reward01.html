One way that we know about the types of tools that were used by Mesopotamian farmers is from finding pictures of tools on objects such as pottery and cylinder seals.

This cylinder seal comes from Mesopotamia and was made in about 2300 B.C. Among other things, it shows a 'seeder-plough'. The plough was a symbol of agriculture and fertility.

<p>
The seeder-plough was an important tool with many different parts. The plough was dragged through the soil by farm animals (probably donkeys or oxen) that were attached to the plough by a yoke.  
<p>
The farmer walked behind the plough, steering with the long handles. The seeds were carried in a bag and dropped through the seed funnel into the trench made by the plough.
